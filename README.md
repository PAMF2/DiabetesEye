## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd diabeteseye

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Your Data

Create a `data/` folder and add your fundus images:

```bash
diabeteseye/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patient_image.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### 3. Run Analysis

```python
from diabeteseye.run_crew import run_analysis

# Your patient data
patient_data = {
    "patient_id": "patient-001",
    "exam_id": "exam-001",
    "images": [
        {
            "uri": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\data\\fundus_image.jpg",
            "type": "fundus",
            "eye": "OD"
        }
    ],
    "clinical": {
        "hba1c": 7.5,
        "bp_systolic": 140,
        "bp_diastolic": 85,
        "duration_years": 10,
        "age": 65,
        "gender": "F",
        "bmi": 28.0,
        "smoker": False,
        "medications": ["Metformin 500mg BID"],
        "last_eye_exam": "2024-01-15",
        "family_history": "Type 2 DM"
    }
}

# Run analysis
results = run_analysis(patient_data)
print("Analysis complete!")
```

## üìä Sample Output

The system generates:

- **Patient Report PDF**: `reports/patient-001_exam-001_patient.pdf`
- **Physician Report PDF**: `reports/patient-001_exam-001_physician.pdf`
- **Follow-up Plan**: Personalized monitoring recommendations

### Analysis Results Structure

```json
{
  "patient_report": "path/to/patient_report.pdf",
  "physician_report": "path/to/physician_report.pdf",
  "analysis": {
    "quality_score": 92.0,
    "dr_grade": 2,
    "confidence": 0.87,
    "risk_6months": 0.15,
    "risk_12months": 0.32,
    "risk_24months": 0.58,
    "recommendations": "3-month follow-up recommended"
  }
}
```
